Are Bitcoin treasury companies. The new.com bubble.

So when they see a company buying and holding bitcoin and trading above its net asset value, they assume it's some irrational bubble, just like the dotcom bubble where many companies ultimately went to zero.

And if people don't understand Bitcoin then they definitely don't understand Bitcoin Treasury companies. These are public or private companies that hold Bitcoin and buy more Bitcoin using cash flow or leverage.

00:00:28:14 - 00:00:57:26

And they often trade at a premium to their net asset value. That looks suspicious to most investors, but the reality is very different from the.com era. During the dotcom bubble. You had early stage startups, no business models, often no revenue, and certainly no profits. These companies were raising billions of dollars to attempt to build something completely new, something untested, speculative and risky in markets that were global and hyper competitive.

Even if they were successful, they were going to get cloned by someone else around the world. That's a hard game to win. Bitcoin Treasury companies are nothing like that.

00:01:07:44 - 00:01:17:43

and unlike a startup, it doesn't require building anything new. Just holding the asset gives you exposure to something growing at 40 to 50% per year.

That's the genius.

00:01:18:57 - 00:01:42:12

And here's where it gets even more interesting. If these companies become overvalued, if they trade above their Nav, they can issue more equity, buy more bitcoin and increase Bitcoin per share for existing shareholders. That's a positive BTC yield within days. Try building a nuclear power plant or a successful billion dollar tech company within days. That's impossible.
